# The-Missing-Semester-of-Your-CS-Education
In this repo, you will find my notes and exercises from "Missing Semester"

This is an MIT course available free online to teach crucial skills such as use of command line, bash, vim, shell scripting and git.
Here is MIT's motivation for running the course:
"During a traditional Computer Science education, chances are you will take plenty of classes that teach you advanced topics within CS, everything from Operating Systems to Programming Languages 
to Machine Learning. But at many institutions there is one essential topic that is rarely covered and is instead left for students to pick up on their own: computing ecosystem literacy."
