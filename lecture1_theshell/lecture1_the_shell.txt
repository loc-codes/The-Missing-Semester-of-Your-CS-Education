Lecture 1 - The Shell

- How does the shell work? When you buy a computer, it comes pre-installed with file explored, web browser etc. The shell is pre-installed with basic programs 
- Programs shell uses are in a lot of paths, extensive list can be found in "echo $PATH"
- ./ = current directory     ../ = parent directory
- CONTROL + L - clear terminal
- sudo - do as superuser (admin)
- sudo su lets you use terminal as root user. You can tell this as LHS will say [root@PATH]# 
instead of [user@PATH]$
